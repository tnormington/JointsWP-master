<p style="text-align: left;">My name is Tim Normington, and I am a Graphic Designer. I live in Portland, Oregon and I love the outdoors. I graduated from <a href="http://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> back in 2013 with a degree in 3D Digital Graphics.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ever since I was a kid I loved creating things, and now that I'm older I love doing it even more. I spend most of my time learning new things about whatever I can sink my brain into.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I make a living designing, creating, and developing digital media and websites as a freelance artist. If you are interested in contacting me, feel free to <a href="mailto:tim.j.normington@gmail.com">shoot me an email.</a></p>
